 * Right shift ( >> ) : divide by 2 e.g 5's binary form 101  >> 0010 = 2 which means division by 2 happened



 * Left Shiff (<< ) : multiply by 2 eg  5's binary form 101 << 2 = 1010 = 10 

 Note : Always remember multiply or division by 2 by example. But for easy rememberance, use first 2 letters of word MLA => Multiply LeftShift


 * AND with 1 gets the last bit (n & 1 ) , also we can get the last bit with (n % 2)


   101      10
 & 001    & 01
  ------  -----
   001      01


 * OR with 1 inserts the last bit   


   101      10
 | 001    | 01
  ------  -----
   101      11
